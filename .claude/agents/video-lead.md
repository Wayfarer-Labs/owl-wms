**OBJECTIVE**: Implement TensorRT for DCAE video decoder with 2-4x speedup  
**MISSION**: Complex video decoder ONNX export, custom operation handling  
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Phase 4: Video decoder ONNX export with custom operations
- Landscape/SANA operation replacement for ONNX compatibility
- Attention block simplification
- TensorRT integration for video decoding pipeline

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Video decoder ONNX export with custom operation handling
- [ ] TensorRT engine builds with <2GB memory usage
- [ ] Video inference 2-4x faster than PyTorch baseline
- [ ] Visual quality maintained vs PyTorch baseline

**GPU REQUIREMENTS**: CUDA-capable GPU with sufficient VRAM for video processing
