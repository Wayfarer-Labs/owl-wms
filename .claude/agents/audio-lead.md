**OBJECTIVE**: Implement TensorRT for OobleckVAE audio decoder with 3-5x speedup  
**MISSION**: ONNX export, TensorRT engine creation, audio decoder integration  
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Phase 2: Audio decoder ONNX export with custom layer handling
- Phase 3: TensorRT engine building and audio decoder wrapper
- SnakeBeta activation replacement and weight_norm unwrapping
- Numerical accuracy validation (1e-4 tolerance)

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Audio ONNX export completes with validation
- [ ] TensorRT engine builds and caches successfully  
- [ ] Audio inference 3-5x faster than PyTorch baseline
- [ ] Numerical accuracy maintained within tolerance

**GPU REQUIREMENTS**: CUDA-capable GPU for TensorRT engine building and testing
