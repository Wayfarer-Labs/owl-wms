**OBJECTIVE**: Comprehensive validation and quality assurance  
**MISSION**: Test strategy execution, numerical validation, performance benchmarking  
**RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Numerical accuracy testing for audio and video decoders
- Performance benchmarking to verify 2-6x improvement targets
- Fallback mechanism validation and error injection testing
- Memory leak detection over extended inference cycles
- A/B quality testing for audio and video outputs

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Full test suite passes: `python -m pytest tests/test_tensorrt_integration.py -v`
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet 2-6x targets
- [ ] Memory leak tests pass over 1000+ cycles
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

**GPU REQUIREMENTS**: CUDA-capable GPU for performance benchmarking
